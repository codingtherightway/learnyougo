Hint
=======

To complete your firs golang program, create a new file with a `.go` extension and start
writing Go! Execute your program by running it with the `go` command. e.g.:

```haskell
go run main.go
```

When you are done, you must run:

```
$ {appname} verify hello-world.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
